### Redesigning My Portfolio (Again)

I’ve rebuilt my portfolio site four times now. Each version felt too generic, too “tutorial-y,” or just not *me*. I kept chasing a balance between looking professional and showing my technical side — but never quite nailed it.

This time, I set a few concrete rules:

- Use Next.js + Tailwind for speed and modularity.
- Keep the design clean, scalable, and easy to update.
- Make the site accessible and easy to scan for recruiters.
- Add some subtle personality without gimmicks.

The result is a portfolio that feels engineered, not decorated. Typed intro, purple accent, and a moving blob background are small touches that hint at personality without shouting for attention.

I ditched terminal-style UIs and overcomplicated animations. Recruiters want clarity and speed, not novelty.

This version isn’t perfect — but it’s the first I’m confident shipping. It’s modular, easy to grow, and honestly, it just *works*.

If you’re stuck in a redesign loop like I was, maybe stop trying to reinvent the wheel and focus on what *you* want your site to say.
